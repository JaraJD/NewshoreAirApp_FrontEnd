# NewshoreAir

In this application we have implemented the multiple routes level where the user can enter a place of origin, a place of destination and a limit of stopovers in his trip. The application will take care of calculating the route and the stopovers that your trip will have as well as its total price.

This application has been designed under a layered architecture.
